## Overview

PhantomGuard is a lightweight, user-driven utility that demonstrates secure local file backup using symmetric encryption.  
It allows users to safely encrypt directories for personal backups and later decrypt them using the same key.  

The repository provides a **safe alternative** to demonstrate encryption techniques without exposing sensitive or malicious functionality.

## Features

- Generate a local symmetric key for file encryption.  
- Encrypt a user-specified folder with individually encrypted files.  
- Decrypt an encrypted folder using the original key.  
- Non-destructive defaults: original files are preserved unless explicitly confirmed for deletion.  
- Fully local operation with no external network communication.
